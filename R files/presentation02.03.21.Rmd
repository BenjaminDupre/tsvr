1.Experimental Design & Hypothesis {data-navmenu="Content"}
=====================================

Row {data-height=350}
-------------------------------------

#### Hypothesis


<!-- There is an event that showed that interospective people seems to be more affected by touch, or hand rubber illusion. -->
<!-- What is heart behavior a property a event or an  (What am I explaining here?) -->

<!-- Why do we react faster when we perceive touch and visual stimuli than when we only perceive visual? Its important to mention that to perform the task only the visual stimuli seems relevant.  -->

Several effects have been found on how heartbeat influences conscious perception. To make sense of these findings we need to further look into effects that seem to occur in opposite directions. Particularly, the finding that shows that heart-evoked activity positively relates to external perception from the visual domain (Park et al., 2014); whereas in the somatosensory domain, heart-evoked activity has a negative relation with external perception (Esra et al., 2020). 

To account for this, **the previously mentioned paper hypothesized that heart-related processes in the interoceptive cortices may interfere differently during the processing of exteroceptive somatosensory and visual signals (Esra et al., 2020)**. 

**To test this hypothesis**, we have developed a withing subject virtual reality experiment that will simulate visual and haptic stimuli as provided by Virtual Reality Equipment and Software. The measurements use to test the hypothesis are VR behavioral derived and Electro Cardiogram Data (ECG). It is important to hold in mind that this is an exploratory study that will test whether vision-haptic integration can be studied with VR and heart data while performing a complex cognitive task.    

Additional to the experimental set up, there are traditional interoceptive measures such as heartbeat accuracy (Garfinkel et al., 2014), Edinburgh Handedness Questionnaire and a cibersicknes questionnaire. This will allow to nest our results in previous literature and control for confounded variables. 

#### Task Design:

We device an experiment that was carried out with an HTC VIVE headset and two lighthouses. The haptic feedback was generated over data-gloves from "Neurodigital Technologies". The heart data was collected using Arduino Uno and a SparkFun AD8232 HR  Monitor. All the data is directly relayed into a log file compile by Unity software through USB2 cable with a 133HZ frequency. Leap motion and data-glove positioning where merged together so to increase accuracy in hands and grabbing information.

The first step of the experiment requires for participants to sign the ethical forms, consent forms as well as the handedness and the base cybersickness questionnaire.

Once in the testing room participants are prepared with the ECG equipment. Then they will go through the pre-experiment heartbeat tracking accuracy test (this consist of silent counting of heartbeat in a 1-minute time window). Next, after getting into the VR headsets and datagloves, the calibration process (letters (a) and (b) in figure 1) begin. Finally the VR task begins. Participants are required to memorize the correct position of the red ball among all the empty slots and distracting colours for a period of X seconds and position the ball (letter c and d in figure 1). They need to perform during three blocks of 36 trials to complete the task.

Details: The red ball will be introduced to one of the hands from the top. They will see a template on the table, which is an identical depiction of the sketch they have seen and memorized at the beginning. The participant has to put the ball in the correct location as fast as possible. The withing subject manipulation that the participant is exposed too is given by the haptic feedback. The base condition is when there is no haptic feedback at all. The incongruous condition is when the ball is placed in the opposite hand from where we visually see the balled being placed. The congruent case is when the participant can feel the haptic stimuli in the same hand the ball is placed. 

Finally, there is a post-experiment for heartbeat tracking accuracy (silent counting of heartbeat in specified 1-minute time window) and a final post-cybersickness questionnaire.

2. Preliminary Analysis {data-navmenu="Content"}
=====================================

In total there were 22 persons included in the experiment and 5 on the pilot version. Among these 22 persons, the age is normally distributed and its range goes from 18 to 50 $(M=24.14,SD=6.42)$. In our sample there are 17 females and 5 male participants. (All participants are between 18 and 30 y/o, except for one that is 50. We decided to include it because its data does not differentiate greatly from all other participants except for the age).

#### Behavioral 
Compared to the previously outline hypothesis, the haptic manipulation had ambiguous behavioral results:

1. In terms of *accuracy*, the within participants ANOVA output a narrow difference between groups and none significant**(is not normally distributed what should I add IC or SD?)** $[F(1,2039)= 0.027, MSE= 0.00, p = 0.974 ,\eta^{2}=0.003]$. For every condition, the mean percentage accuracy --computed for every participant and then globally-- were: 

* Base visual stimuli $94.57\%$ 
* Incongruent visuo-haptic stimuli was $94.99\%$ 
* Congruent visuo-haptic stimuli it was $94.80\%$ 

  This indicates that the task elicited a 5% mistake rate on average. This is too small of a sample to capture significant differences between manipulated conditions (cong V_H,inc V_H, base). In other words, mistakes occur so rarely that is not possible to subdivide them into smaller groups. 

2. In term of Response Time (RT), the within participants ANOVA results for were significant $[F(2,42)= 3.52, SSn= 0.03, p = 0.03^* ,\eta^{2}=0.003]$. The response time range for base stimuli was between 3.12s to 6.00s $(M=3.75 s, SD=0.64)$, for incongruent visuo-haptic stimuli was from 3.12 to 5.97 $(M=3.72s, SD=0.63)$ and for the congruent visuo-haptic stimuli it was from 3.13 to 5.96 $(M=3.69s, SD=0.62)$  . 

We can observe that for both ANOVA the $\eta^{2}$ is low, although for RT for the haptic manipulation proved significant. To look further into this later on we run a multilevel analysis. The idea is that running this analysis we will dimension the relative importance of other factors such as participant, set and level on the response time results. We expect for individual differences to explain great part of the variance and the other variables too. Our manipulation nonetheless, is likely to reflect multisensory efforts, therefore expected to be small but still significant relative to the complete answering time.

        dv = .(diff),
        wid = .(ptcp),
        within = .(stimulus),
        within_covariates = set,
        detailed = T)
print(output_anova)
# Improve this Chi square test for accuracy it has problems - non-normal residual
chisq <- chisq.test(table(tsvr$stimulus,tsvr$accuracy))
```
#### Questionaires

After the VR experience, participants on average reported lower heart rate count for the post VR heartbeat tracking $(M=49.25,SD=20.04)$ than the pre VR heartbeat tracking  $(M=57.28, SD=19.45)$. The reported difference was not significant $[F(1,40)= 1.73, SSn= 0.03, p = 0.19 ,\eta^{2}=0.04]$ (two participants where remove because they did not performed the post-experiment measurements).

#### Heart-Behavioral Results. 

There are 4 participants with artifacts that could not be identified by the algorith on different heart cycles (Ptcp number 2,3,13,11).

Because the error rate is low we did not consider an ANOVA between the heart-cycle and error rate. Only for RT. Additionally, if we base ourselves in previous literature only, is hard to hypothesize results over the effect of heart-cycle on RT. From literature we expect to see a significant effect, but since in our task there is simultaneous visual and haptic stimuli, the overall conclusion is ambiguous. We can speculate, if the visual effect primes over the haptic effect, we would expect that for the systolic heart cycle there is an improvement in performance. Whereas, if the haptic stimuli primes the visual for systolic heart-cycle, we can expect a determent in performance. 

We run a three group ANOVA that gives significant results $[F(2,34)= 4.12, SSn= 0.03, p = 0.02^* ,\eta^{2}=0.009]$. The following figure show us that systolic heart cycle was slower than the diastolic heart cycle. Also that when there as no vibration the response was slower than either case. Not all participants show the same results. As a matter of fact half (ptcp: 7,5,1,17,19,18,12,10,20) participant did not showed this pattern. It will be relevant the Multilevel analysis (IMMROVE CORRECT!!!!)

4. Multilevel Analysis {data-navmenu="Content"}
=====================================
Row
-------------------------------------
### **Multi-level Model**


We fitted a multilevel model that explained response time (diff). Which in the previous section showeed significant for several independent variables. The following presented model considers as fixed effects: trial level, set number and stimulus conditions and heart cycle. Additionally, considers as random effects the participant variable. The formulation would look something like this: $$diff = 1+lvl+set+stimulus+zyklus+(1|ptcp)$$ 

We wonder. Would multilevel analysis also help us determine or not, a significant difference between congruent and incongruent visuo-haptic stimuli? No base condition considered. To do this, we removed all base condition observations, thus leaving a subset with 553 less observations. The formula applied is the same as before.



The results from the randome effects show that 16% of the variance in time response is accounted by the difference in participants. The estimator most prominent on impact size is found for level variable $[M=-0.20, Pr<0.001, 97.5\%, CI = [-0.22, -0.17]]$. The second most relevant was the congruent visuo-haptic stimulus $[M=-0.20, Pr<0.001, 97.5\%, CI = [-0.22, -0.17]]$. There were no significant results found for the incongruent visuo-haptic stimulus.

***From a Behavior stand point, the coherence of the viuso-haptic stimuli notably makes the reaction faster. Nonetheless, the fact that there is not a significant result for the incongruent visuo-haptic stimuli might cast some light on the multisensory integration of ambiguous sources. As observed in the preliminary results section, the significant difference is between no visuo-haptic stimuli and congruent visuo-haptic stimuli. The incongruent case sits between this two. As an intermediate case, where none is the slowest  and congruent is the fastest**

a.- Inter beat intervals where detected using Hooman Sedghamiz (2018) algorithm. I consider the two seconds after the vibrations starts. The analysis was run without getting into detail of artifact removal.The removal of IBI where done using  â€˜rmoutliersâ€™ MATLAB function. 

At this point there were no significant difference between beat intervals.

5. Interpretation {data-navmenu="Content"}
=====================================
### **Results Enumeration (must be edited)**

a. Most of the differences in time response are explained by individual differences. 

b. There is for all participants a decrease in time responses as they play more showed by level and set influence. This is also observed in accuracy, although because is not significant it will not be included (?). The improvement of participants throughout the time played indicates learning.  

c. Once removed from the effects we had just mentioned we can now look into the variable of our interest. How do people react to congruent incongruent visuo-haptic stimuli on VR? Our results indicate that the congruence in both senses leads to improvement in performance. Counter to our intuition the incongruent case would still be better in performance than the only one visual case or base case (although this results can only be observed, are not significant the difference is too small.)  

d. There where no significant differences found on R-peak distances. 

e. After the VR experience participants on average reported lower heart rate count for the post VR $(M=49.25,SD=20.04)$ case than the pre VR case $(M=57.28, SD=19.45)$
